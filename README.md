# Firebase-Angular-auth
Bare bones user authentication services for a Firebase/Angular application

## Getting started

Ensure you have up-to-date versions of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) then install dependencies by running:

`bower install` then `(sudo) npm install`

Set up a new [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) database and save your unique Firebase URL as a constant in app.js.

Now just run `grunt serve` to get started.
